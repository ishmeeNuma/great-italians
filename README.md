<p>ok, so my first attempt at putting a <em>completed</em> project up on github was unsuccessful.  well actually, it was 'half successful'--but is there really such a thing?  i mean at this point in my journey, perhaps there is.</p>  

<p>anyhoo, this is an attempt I've hatched to try and perhaps this attempt will work out better?  perhaps not.  either way, i plan to learn something somehow.</p>
